# Jump_Quest

This project is a 2D Platforming game made with the Godot engine. Using the brutal obstacle courses from Maplestory as inspiration, Jump Quest is difficult, but rewarding. Avoid obstacles, enemies and conquer the terrain to achieve victory! The dynamic movement and physics provide the player with an enjoyable and addicting experience. The project is still in its infancy, but progress is quickly being made! Any feedback would be greatly apprecitaed.
